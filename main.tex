\section*{Introduction}

The Riemann–Roch theorem for curves stands as one of the central results in algebraic geometry and complex analysis, establishing a profound connection between the geometry of algebraic curves and the algebraic properties of functions defined on them. Originally formulated by Bernhard Riemann in the mid-19th century as a statement about meromorphic functions on compact Riemann surfaces, the theorem was subsequently refined and completed by Gustav Roch, who identified the essential correction term involving holomorphic differentials that characterizes the modern form of the theorem. 

At its core, the theorem provides an explicit formula that determines the dimension of the space of meromorphic functions or sections associated with a given divisor on a curve, accounting for both the prescribed zeros and poles and the intrinsic topological invariant known as the genus. This result elegantly encapsulates how local conditions imposed on a curve interact with its global geometric characteristics, and it forms a foundational bridge linking analysis, topology, and algebra. As such, the Riemann–Roch theorem not only facilitates concrete calculations in the theory of algebraic curves, but also inspired numerous subsequent developments, including Friedrich Karl Schmidt's extension to algebraic curves over fields of finite characteristic in 1931 and modern generalizations such as the Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch theorem, all of which underscore its pivotal role in the broader landscape of algebraic geometry.

The goal of this semester report is to document the gradual process of an attempt to prove Riemann-Roch theorem for algebraic curves from the perspective of a beginner in algebraic geometry. We will start by briefly reviewing some of the categorical notions required to formally state the problem and its properties, and then we move on to the notion of divisors in order to complete the problem statement.  This project report can be read by anybody who has done an introductory course in algebraic geometry, alongside some proficiency in category theory and commutative algebra. \textbf{Also, most importantly, none of the statements written here are novel, and are instead pre-established statements by experts in the field of algebraic geometry and category theory, primarily by Prof. Robin Hartshorne in his ever-famous title \textit{Algebraic Geometry}. This is merely a compilation of useful results one might need to familiarize oneself with the material, and then they would need to turn to an official text and work out further nuances and details over time}.
